                    <p class="p">
                        This project explores densifying as a systemic condition through a simulated urban traffic
                        environment. Starting from the premise that population growth intensifies not only the number of
                        vehicles but also the complexity and pressure placed on infrastructural systems, the simulation
                        models how increasing density leads to congestion, inefficiency, and emergent breakdowns in
                        movement.
                        <br><br>
                        Using p5.js, I constructed a simplified micro-world where roads and vehicles incrementally
                        accumulate over time. Roads represent expanding urban infrastructure, while colored points
                        represent individual vehicles. As the system densifies, more vehicles are introduced and begin
                        to occupy the same limited paths. Vehicles move with semi-random behavior and intermittently
                        stop along the roads, producing moments of congestion that echo real-world traffic jams caused
                        not by singular events, but by cumulative density and friction within the system.
                        <br><br>
                        Rather than depicting a realistic city, the simulation abstracts urban traffic into behaviors
                        and relationships: movement versus obstruction, flow versus accumulation, expansion versus
                        overload. Numerical counters within the interface track the growth of both roads and vehicles,
                        making density legible not only visually but quantitatively. As these values increase, the
                        system’s performance visibly degrades, shifting attention from individual forms to
                        collective behavior and emergent patterns.

                    <p class="p">
                        Densifying examines density not as a static condition, but as a self-amplifying process. Rather
                        than representing traffic as an image of urban life, this project uses simulation to ask how
                        accumulation itself becomes a governing force. Roads and vehicles are not designed as finished
                        forms; they are introduced gradually, allowing congestion to emerge from repetition, proximity,
                        and limited space.
                        <br><br>
                        As population increases, infrastructure expands in response—yet each new road invites more
                        vehicles, and each new vehicle further strains the system. Density here is not simply a matter
                        of quantity, but of interaction: vehicles pause unpredictably, movement slows, and localized
                        congestion spreads across the network. What begins as circulation slowly transforms into
                        friction.
                        <br><br>
                        By abstracting cars into colored points and roads into minimal paths, the simulation shifts
                        focus away from realism and toward behavior. Traffic jams are not explicitly scripted; they
                        arise as a consequence of densification itself. In this sense, the project treats congestion as
                        an emergent phenomenon rather than a design flaw.
                        <br><br>
                        This vivarium models a critical feedback loop common in contemporary cities: growth produces
                        infrastructure, infrastructure produces more growth, and the system ultimately becomes
                        overwhelmed by its own density. Through simulation, Densifying reframes urban traffic as a
                        living system—one that reveals how complexity, when unchecked, can undermine the very efficiency
                        it promises.

                        The road network is generated from intersecting vertical and horizontal lines, where each new
                        cross introduces additional axes and forces the system to rebuild itself. As more crosses are
                        added, intersections and segments multiply, increasing route complexity. Rather than being drawn
                        once as a fixed layout, roads accumulate over time, allowing infrastructure to expand
                        reactively. This mirrors urban densification, where growth produces complexity as a byproduct
                        rather than as a consciously designed composition.

                        Vehicle generation is tied to real time rather than frame count, causing density to build
                        gradually instead of appearing all at once. This temporal accumulation makes densification
                        legible as ongoing pressure within the system, reinforcing density as a process unfolding over
                        time rather than a fixed or instantaneous condition.

                        behavior and performance over representation, encouraging the viewer to read the system
                        analytically rather than narratively, with data functioning as an integral part of the visual
                        language.
